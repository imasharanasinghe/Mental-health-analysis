# About This Project

## 🧠 Mental Health Risk Assessment System

This application uses machine learning to predict mental health conditions, stress levels, and severity based on various lifestyle and personal factors.

## 🔍 How It Works

Our system analyzes multiple factors that contribute to mental health risks:

### Personal Factors
- Age
- Gender
- Occupation
- Country of residence

### Lifestyle Factors
- Sleep patterns
- Work hours
- Physical activity levels
- Social media usage
- Diet quality
- Smoking habits
- Alcohol consumption

### Health History
- Consultation history
- Medication usage

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Machine Learning Models
The system employs ensemble machine learning algorithms for high accuracy:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

### Model Evaluation
- 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance assessment
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
- Multiple algorithm comparison to select the best performer

### Data Preprocessing
- Automated data cleaning and normalization
- Handling of missing values
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature encoding for categorical variables

## 🎯 Key Features

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethics

### Data Privacy
- All data processing is done locally on your device
- No personal information is collected or transmitted
- No data is stored permanently

### Ethical Considerations
- This tool is for educational purposes only
- Not a substitute for professional medical advice
